/*Example of how HTML will be generated by JavaScript DOM which is written in "/public/code/statistics/statistics.js" based on the response of the backend
This example assumes that the backend only responded with midTerm field which is not always the case

    <div class="margin-on-nav statistics-main-container" role="faculty" id="statistics-container"> ==> This DIV is in the statisticsPage.ejs and not generated by the JS DOM Code can be edited directly
        <div id="midTerm-statistics-container" class="field-container"> ==> This DIV is generated by JS DOM in makeFieldStatistics() function it takes classes as an array of strings each string is a class you can have the classes inside the array refered to in a comment "Field container classes" where makeFieldStatistics is called (The callback on load event added to the window)
            <div id="midTerm-field-title" class="field-div shadow">Mid Term Exam</div> ==> This displays the field name which the statistics are for takes value dynamiclly classes are in the same function above
            <div id="midTerm-title-div" class="field-div shadow">Total Number of Participants : 13</div> ==> This displays the total number of participants if exam / students if not the value calculated dynamiclly
            <div id="midTerm-stdDev-div" class="field-div shadow">Standard Deviation : 4.39</div> ==> This displays the standard deviation the value calculated dynamiclly
            <div id="midTerm-meanValue-div" class="field-div shadow">Mean Value : 20.77</div> ==> This displays the mean value the value calculated dynamiclly
            //Each of the divs above have classes as an array of strings in makeFieldStatistics for the title it is refered to as "Field Title Classes" and the other three share the same classes array as "Field Parameters Classes"
            <div id="doughtnut-chart-container" class="chart-container"> ==> This takes it's classes in makeFieldStatistics function where a comment is refered as "Chart container classes"
                <canvas class="shadow chart-canvas" id="doughtnut-canvas" width="300" height="300" style="display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 300px; width: 300px;"></canvas> ==> This canvas is where the chart is displayed takes it classes form the makeFieldStatistics function where a comment says "Canvas classes"
                //Note: The style attribute in canvas is added by chart.js and not by the DOM do not Change
            </div>
            <div id="histogram-chart-container" class="chart-container"> ==> This takes exacly the same classes as the above div if need to have different styles use the id and it should work for all fields
                <canvas class="shadow chart-canvas" id="histogram-canvas" width="600" height="300" style="display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 300px; width: 600px;"></canvas> ==> This takes exacly the same classes as the histogram does if there is a need for styles specific to one of which use the id
                //Note: The style attribute in canvas is added by chart.js and not by the DOM do not Change
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
